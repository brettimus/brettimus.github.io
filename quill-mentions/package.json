  "readme": "# quill-mentions\n_very much under construction_\n\nA mentions module for quilljs\n\n## Docs\n\nif you build docs, be warned. shit fails if the _full path_ to your repo includes any folders with an underscore. See the issue and fix [here](https://github.com/brettimus/quill-mentions/issues/1).\n\n\n## Usage\n`quill-mentions` exposes a single global variable, `QuillMentions`. \n\nTo include `quill-mentions`, simply add the relevant styles, the Quill editor itself, and the quill-mentions module on your page.\n\nPass the global `QuillMentions` contsructor to Quill's [registerModule](http://quilljs.com/docs/api/#quillregistermodule) function, and add `mentions` to your module config when you instantiate your editor(s).\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/quill-mentions.css\">\n...\n<script src=\"/path/to/quill.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/path/to/quill-mentions.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  Quill.registerModule(\"mentions\", QuillMentions);\n  var editor = new Quill('#editor-container', {\n    modules: {\n      'mentions': { /* add your configuration here */ },\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n## Style Dependencies...\n**NYW**\n\n\n# v-3 goals\n* ~~inject choices (as array)~~\n* ~~parse contents~~\n* ~~use `@` to summon popover with possible choices matched to text~~\n* ~~vertically align popover to position of calling `@`~~\n\n# v-2 goals\n* ~~Customizable no-match-found messages~~ TODO - figre out how to configure so there's _no message_. Was running into issues trying this out.\n* ~~Keyboard events for up and down arrows~~ Also for escape and enter!\n* ~~Insert data with mention into markup (this might require deviating from custom quill format because custom formats are too nascent :confused:)~~ Currently, the `data-mention` attribute from a matching `li` is appended to the class of a mention `span`. This is hacky, but it avoids having to manually insert HTML...\n* Horizontally align the popover\n\n# V-1 goals\n* Refactor with MVC\n* Break out defaultFactory (the main default object has toooo much shit on it.)\n* **Horizontally align the popover**\n\n# TODO\n* Find alternative to current use of `transform: translateZ` on the popover list items...\n* Write more robust regex for parsing names\n* Hide view after insert\n* Determine horizontal rendering of mentions container.\n* Add keyboard events for up and down arrows\n* ~~Don't allow 'womp womp' message to be clicked~~\n* ~~Render ql-mentions container in a more logical position~~\n",
