  "readme": "# :construction: quill-mentions\n_Under construction_\n\nAn at-style mentions module for quilljs.\n\n## Get it.\nYou can get `quill-mentions` through npm\n```bash\n$ npm install quill-modules\n```\nOr you can just take the files from the `dist` folder. That works too.\n\n## Use it.\n`quill-mentions` exposes a single global variable, `QuillMentions`. \n\nTo include mentions in your Quill project, simply add the stylesheet and all the Javascripts to your page.\n\nPass the global `QuillMentions` contsructor to Quill's [registerModule](http://quilljs.com/docs/api/#quillregistermodule) function, and add `mentions` to your module config when you instantiate your editor(s).\n\n```html\n<head>\n  ...\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/quill-mentions.css\">\n  ...\n</head>\n<body>\n  ...\n  <script src=\"/path/to/quill.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"/path/to/quill-mentions.min.js\"></script>\n  <script>\n    Quill.registerModule(\"mentions\", QuillMentions);\n    var editor = new Quill('#editor-container', {\n      modules: {\n        'mentions': { /* add your configuration here */ },\n      }\n    });\n  </script>\n\n</body>\n```\n\n## Docs\n\nThe docs are not as exhaustive as they should be, but they live (nonetheless) in the `docs` folder.\n\n:warning: If you build the docs, be warned that your build will fail if the _full path_ to your clone/fork of the repo includes any folders with an underscore. See the issue and fix [here](https://github.com/brettimus/quill-mentions/issues/1).\n\n\n## Style Dependencies...\n**Not Yet Written**\n\n\n# v-3 goals\n* ~~inject choices (as array)~~\n* ~~parse contents~~\n* ~~use `@` to summon popover with possible choices matched to text~~\n* ~~vertically align popover to position of calling `@`~~\n\n# v-2 goals\n* ~~Customizable no-match-found messages~~ TODO - figre out how to configure so there's _no message_. Was running into issues trying this out.\n* ~~Keyboard events for up and down arrows~~ Also for escape and enter!\n* ~~Insert data with mention into markup (this might require deviating from custom quill format because custom formats are too nascent :confused:)~~ Currently, the `data-mention` attribute from a matching `li` is appended to the class of a mention `span`. This is hacky, but it avoids having to manually insert HTML...\n* Horizontally align the popover\n\n# V-1 goals\n* ~~Refactor with MVC~~\n* Break out defaultFactory (the main default object has toooo much :shit: on it.)\n* **Horizontally align the popover**\n* Refactor styles to not rely on dom elements\n\n# TODO\n* Find alternative to current use of `transform: translateZ` on the popover list items...\n* Write more robust regex for parsing names (separate for work)\n* ~~Hide view after insert~~\n* Determine horizontal rendering of mentions container.\n* ~~Add keyboard events for up and down arrows~~\n* ~~Don't allow 'womp womp' message to be clicked~~\n* ~~Render ql-mentions container in a more logical position~~\n",
