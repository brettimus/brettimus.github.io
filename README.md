===================

This is my personal site. Why are you looking at this repo? 
That's weird. 
Do you think it would be okay if I walked into your house 
and inspected source?

No. It wouldn't.

(_Actually it would be totally fine! Feel free to snoop around. Let me know if you see anything awry or if you have questions._)
