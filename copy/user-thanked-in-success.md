## Notes
The crux of this email seems to be its call to action. 
I have put a moratorium on emails that don't provide a 
motivation to engage with the app.

Without a good CTA, I am not comfortable launching this.

## Scenario
James was mentioned in a thank you by Jormes during Jormes's post followup.

## Subject
With Thanks from Jormes

## Body
Hello James,

### Lead - ask
Jormes wanted to say thanks for the help with their ask, "I need stuff."

### Lead - offer
Jormes wanted to say thanks for taking up their offer, "You need my stuff."

### Follow
Your name sits on their {{ ask || offer }} as a little nod to all you've done.

### Follow - goofy
Your name sits on their {{ ask || offer }} as a little nod to all you've done. 
(You're famous!)

### Follow/CTI - impossible
Tell them, "You're Welcome"

### CTA (doesn't make much sense :disappointed:)
Chime in on their post to say "You're Welcome"

### CTA - alt / maybe impossible (don't think we have hearts on stories yet)

Thanks for making {{community.name}} Switchboard great.

Fondly,
