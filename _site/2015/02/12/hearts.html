<p>This week I pushed my first public-facing feature for <a href="http://switchboardhq.com/">Switchboard</a>, <br />
the place where I happen to work.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, “What is this feature?” And, in that case, <em>Thanks for asking!</em></p>

<p>It is (quite literally) a bunch of hearts and (quite figuratively) my baby.</p>

<p>I pitched the idea in a redesign meeting, implemented it, and wrote the initial copy (later improved by a professional) to introduce it to our users- all in time for Valentine’s Day! (D’awwh.)</p>

<h3 id="a-little-background">A Little Background</h3>

<p>We wanted a way for our users to interact with posts on Switchboard even when they didn’t have something to necessarily <em>say</em> to the original poster. </p>

<p>Since we, as active users of our own platform, often found ourselves thinking “I love this post!”, a heart seemed only natural.</p>

<h3 id="but-does-it-animate-tho"><em>But does it animate, tho???</em></h3>

<p>The day before we launched the hearts, I posted in our main Slack channel asking for feedback.</p>

<p>Our designer, knowing my weakness for cool animations, half-jokingly posted a link to a handful of <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/02/11/subtle-click-feedback-effects/">awesome click effects</a> released on <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a> earlier that day. (P.S., the codes are up on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/codrops/ClickEffects">here</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="jelena">jelena</h3>

<p>We ended up using the <code>jelena</code> effect on our heart. (Side-note: Gleaned from the comments on the blog post that introduced the effects, it seemed as though every effect in the library has the name of a city from Yugoslavia.)</p>
