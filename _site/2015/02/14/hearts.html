<p>This week I pushed my first public-facing feature for <a href="http://switchboardhq.com/">Switchboard</a>, the place where I happen to work.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, “What is this feature?” Great question!</p>

<p>It is (quite literally) a bunch of hearts and (quite figuratively) my baby.</p>

<p>I pitched the idea in a meeting, implemented it a week later, and wrote the initial copy (later improved by a more skilled pen) to introduce it to our users- all in time for Valentine’s Day! (D’awwh.)</p>

<h2 id="a-little-background">A Little Background</h2>

<p>Sorry. It still probably isn’t clear what the hearts are.</p>

<p>Short story short, we wanted a way for our users to interact with posts on Switchboard even when they didn’t necessarily have something to <em>say</em> to the original poster. </p>

<p>Since we, as active users of our own platform, often found ourselves thinking “I love this post!”, a heart seemed only natural.</p>

<h2 id="but-does-it-animate-tho"><em>But does it animate, tho???</em></h2>

<p>The day before we launched the hearts, I posted in our company’s main Slack channel (colloquially, <em>#kitchen</em>) asking for feedback.</p>

<p>Our designer, knowing my weakness for cool animations, half-jokingly replied with a link to a handful of <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/02/11/subtle-click-feedback-effects/">awesome click effects</a> released on <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a> earlier that day.</p>

<p>These were some hot and fresh new animations, and I am all about the new, fresh hotness when it comes to cool CSS animations. As well as everything else on the internets.</p>

<p>Short story still short, I borrowed some of their codes off of <a href="https://github.com/codrops/ClickEffects">the Githubs</a>, and wrapped it into <a href="https://github.com/brettimus/click_effects-rails">an asset gem</a> for our lovely little Rails app… all in time for lunch (which was tofu and rice, but that’s besides the point)!</p>

<h3 id="jelena">jelena</h3>

<p>We ended up using the <code>jelena</code> effect on our heart. </p>

<p>It’s this wonderful, expanding concentric ring that emits from our heart icon when you click it. </p>

<p>It. Is. Delightful.</p>

<p>(<em>Side-note: After reading the comments on the codrops blog post that introduced all of the effects, it seems that every effect is named after an ex-Yugoslavic city.</em>)</p>

<p>I don’t think my description does the animation any justice, though… so (shameless plug) if you are belong to a Switchboard, you should just meander on over to one of your communities and start hearting some posts!</p>
